## What is BMI (body mass index)?
The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure of relative size based on the mass and height of an individual.

The index was devised by Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing what he called "social physics", between 1830 and 1850.[2] The BMI for a person is defined as their body mass divided by the square of their height—with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2
